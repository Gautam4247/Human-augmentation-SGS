          <h5>What Is a Bionic eye?</h5>
          <p>
            bionic eye, electrical prosthesis surgically implanted into a human eye in order to allow for the transduction of light (the change of light from the environment into impulses the brain can process) in people who have sustained severe damage to the retina.

            The retina is a light-sensitive tissue layer found within the inner eye that transforms images obtained from the outside world into neural impulses, which are then passed along the optic nerve to the thalamus and ultimately to the primary visual cortex (the visual processing centre), located in the occipital lobe of the brain.

             It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

          <h5>How Does Bionic eye Work?</h5>
          <p>
            People who are most likely to benefit from a bionic eye are middle-aged or elderly with very poor vision associated with age-related macular degeneration (a condition that causes degeneration in the cells found in the centre of the retina) or retinitis pigmentosa (a group of hereditary diseases that destroy photosensitive rod and cone cells in the retina). While the retina is damaged by those diseases, there must be some retinal ganglion cells that remain intact in order for the bionic eye to function as intended.
